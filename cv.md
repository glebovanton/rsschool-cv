About me
---------

**My life**

My friends taught me to play the guitar when I was 11. 
Later I played the African djembe. Since then I like to play 
it whether alone or not. In my free time, I am fond of recording 
and DJing. Together with my wife, we often go running and cycling. 
We love to travel despite COVID :). And of course, I can't but 
mention the time I spend on self-education.

**My destiny**

I used to work as a sound engineer. But one way or another, 
I came across programming, though I considered it too difficult 
to start WEB developing. I created my first simple landing pages 
in WordPress and native HTML + CSS. But then I came up with the 
idea of making the websites more interactive. And started learning 
JS with Jquery. It seemed to be just another way of self-development 
until I realized that I was really into programming. So, my hobby 
has become my new profession. And I really hope to become a good 
full-stack developer.

Experience
----------

**Briefly about my experience**

I started out as a freelancer for my friends. Worked with `HTML` + `CSS` + `JQyery` + `JS`. 
I joined the Noer in 2017. And I continued projects by adding `VUE` + `Webpack` + `Figma` + 
`TargetProcess` + `Git` to my stack. The Politico project has been of great benefit. 
Here I dive deeper into using the technologies I already knew. In addition, 
I realized the need and began to use `Jira` + `Jest` + `Accessibility` + `BrowserStack` + 
`Storybook`. On Politico, I had 6 sub-projects with different teams. And I really 
liked the practice of `Code review` + `Scrum` + `English practice`.
